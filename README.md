# PacMan Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 4

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to create a moving PacMan through the use of 4 images. The project also requires the PacMan to change direction when reaching the end of the screen.

### Features

* A beautiful looking yellow PacMan
* A thrilling journey across a screen
* The unending question of whether PacMan will turn before it is too late...

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the PacMen Exercise directory to your local machine.
Open a new tab in your browser window.
Drag and drop the pacmen.js file onto the new tab.
The project will load an appear in your browser.
You will see a bright yellow Pacman eating it's way across your screen.

## Usage

### Usage:
Having a rough day? Can't seem to see the positive side of things? Well you are in luck. Using this PacMan project may not only turn your day around, but quite possibly your life. Use it as often as you like. Hell, run it on various machines at the same time if you can. The more exposure to this amazing little yellow creature you expose yourself to, the more happiness you will generate in your life, and let's be honest here, there is no such thing as too much happiness.

### Expected outcomes:
Freedom. 
Unbridled happiness.
Unicorns.

## Support

If by some unexpected act of nature PacMan stops packing, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.

## Roadmap

PacMan has only just begun his adventures... His roadmap is slowly but surely building up to be one of the greatest to ever be travelled. He may turn different colors, he may move in other directions on the screen, he may decide to change size and he may even get a girlfriend. Keep your eyes peeled for more adventures.
