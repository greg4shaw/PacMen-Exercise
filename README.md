# PacMan Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 7

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A project to create animated PacMen through the use of 4 images. The project requires a button to create a PacMan. Each time this is pressed a new PacMan is created at a different place on the screen. Once you are satisfied with the amount of PacMen, the 'Start Game' button can be clicked. This will start the PacMen packing in all directions at different velocities. The PacMen will also change directions when reaching the borders of the screen. WARNING: They will keep packing as long as you keep watching.

### Features

* As many beautiful looking yellow PacMen as you desire
* Many thrilling journeys across the screen
* The unending question of whether each PacMan will turn before it is too late...

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the PacMen Exercise directory to your local machine.
Open a new tab in your browser window.
Drag and drop the pacmen.js file onto the new tab.
The project will load an appear in your browser.
You will see two buttons on the screen. 'Add PacMan' will add a PacMan when clicked. As many Pacmen can be added as necessary.
'Start Game' will begin the movement of the PacMen across the screen.

## Usage

### Usage:
Having a rough day? Can't seem to see the positive side of things? Well you are in luck. Using this PacMen project may not only turn your day around, but quite possibly your life. Use it as often as you like. Hell, run it on various machines at the same time if you can. The more exposure to this amazing little yellow creature you expose yourself to, the more happiness you will generate in your life, and let's be honest here, there is no such thing as too much happiness.

### Expected outcomes:
Freedom. 
Unbridled happiness.
Unicorns.

## Support

If by some unexpected act of nature PacMan stops packing, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.

## Roadmap

PacMan has only just begun his adventures... His roadmap is slowly but surely building up to be one of the greatest to ever be travelled. He may turn different colors upon hitting a border, he may decide to randomly change size while he is travelling, he may hit the border after a certain amount of times and then disappear, and he may even get a girlfriend. Keep your eyes peeled for more adventures.
